= Introduction =

The Google Calendar Connector Kit is a set of tools that enable users to look up free/busy information for their domain across Microsoft Exchange and Google Apps. Google Apps users can see free/busy information for Microsoft Exchange users from within the Google Calendar resource scheduling interface, and Microsoft Exchange users can see free/busy information for Google Apps users from within the Microsoft Outlook calendar scheduler.

The Google Calendar Connector Kit is a set of server-installed tools that require knowledgeable installation and configuration, tailored to the particulars of a customer's environment.  These tools are only the technological part of the integration experience.

Before proceeding to install the Google Calendar Connector Kit, please read and understand the important Security Considerations outlined below.

= Overview =

The Google Calendar Connector Kit contains three separate services, but only two need to be installed and configured in order to provide two-way free/busy scheduling.  The three services are:

  * The Google Calendar Connector Web Service
  * The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service
  * The Google Calendar Connector Plug-In

The Web Service provides free/busy scheduling for Google Apps users, while either the Sync Service or Plug-In, but not both, provides free/busy scheduling for Microsoft Exchange users.  Customers will commonly run either the Google Calendar Connector Web Service and Sync Service, or the Google Calendar Connector Web Service and Plug-In.

*Why are there two different services for Microsoft Exchange users?*

The easy answer is that there are scenarios where each service might provide a better user experience. The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service and the Google Calendar Connector Plug-In both provide free/busy scheduling for Microsoft Exchange users. The Sync Service may make more sense for an environment where synchronizing free/busy information into Exchange is efficient for the large majority of users. The Plug-In may make more sense in other cases. The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service and Plug-In also represent different installation methods.<


The diagrams below illustrates the similarities and differences between the components of the Google Calendar Connector Kit:

*_The option of writing Google Calendar free/busy data into an Exchange
mailbox is possible, but is not the recommended configuration. The
appointment writer has very limited functionality and is considered an
experimental feature._*

= Google Calendar Connector Web Service =

The Google Calendar Connector Web Service allows Google Apps users to retrieve free/busy information for Microsoft Exchange users. This tool is an ASP.NET web application that queries the Microsoft Exchange free/busy store in real-time, on behalf of Google Calendar. The ASP.NET web application should be installed on a system that has access to your Exchange server and Active Directory.

Below is a diagram illustrating the operation of the Web Service:

http://google-calendar-connectors.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/connectors/docs/images/web_service.png

The following is a step-by-step process overview of the Web Service:

  # A user opens the Google Calendar Scheduler dialog, and enters the e-mail address of a Microsoft Exchange user, user@acme.com. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # Google Calendar checks to see if external free/busy look up is enabled for the current Google Apps domain, and if so, it finds the Intranet or Internet accessible URL of the Google Calendar Connector Web Service that has been installed on your server. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # Google Calendar uses HTTP POST to send a free/busy look up request for user@acme.com to the Google Calendar Connector Web Service. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # The Google Calendar Connector Web Service parses the free/busy request and issues an Active Directory LDAP query for the user account that matches user@acme.com. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # Microsoft Active Directory returns a user object to the Google Calendar Connector Web Service which contains the Exchange mailbox name and Display Name for user@acme.com.
  # The Google Calendar Connector Web Service parses the returned LDAP results and issues a single WebDAV query to the Exchange free/busy store. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # The WebDAV query returns with free/busy information for the matching user, assuming proper access privileges.
  # The Google Calendar Connector Web Service retrieves appointment data for events occurring within the free/busy query's date range, assuming access privileges have been enabled. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # The Google Calendar Connector Web Service merges the separate appointment details with the free/busy information and Display Name of the user.
  # The Google Calendar Connector Web Service uses HTTP POST to send the combined free/busy and appointment details back to Google Calendar's Scheduler. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # Google Calendar's Scheduler receives the results and displays the data appropriately in Scheduler view.

Notes about data security and access permissions:

  * 1. Any Google Apps user in your domain.
  * 2. The Google Apps domain administrator or Google defines the URL of the Google Calendar Connector Web Service.
  * 3. The Google Calendar Connector Web Service must be accessible by the user's browser.
  * 4. The LDAP query is executed with standard LDAP logon credentials.
  * 6. The WebDAV request is issued with Exchange user permissions sufficient for read-only access to the free/busy store.
  * 8. The WebDAV request is issued with Exchange user permissions sufficient to read event details from another user's mailbox.
  * 9. If the event has been marked as "private", the event details will not be returned.
  * 11. The merged free/busy and appointment data is not permanently stored on Google servers, but due to javascript limitations, it is routed through a Google server on its return to the user's browser.

= Google Calendar Connector Sync Service =

The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service allows Microsoft Exchange users to see free/busy information for Google Apps users. The sync service is a Windows service written in C# that periodically queries Google Apps for updated free/busy information and writes the changes directly into Exchange. The changes are written directly into the Exchange free/busy store. 

*_NOTE: For users that have both a Google Apps and Exchange mailbox free/busy data from Google Calendar can be written into a user's calendar as a placeholder appointment (an empty appointment that represents the free/busy information from Google Calendar). The Appointment writer option is an experimental option as it supports a very limited set of functionality and is NOT an appointment/data synchronization utility._*

When a Microsoft Exchange user looks up free/busy information for a Google Apps user, the Exchange server accesses the local free/busy information written by the sync service. The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service should be installed on a server that has network access to your Active Directory server and your Microsoft Exchange server.

http://google-calendar-connectors.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/connectors/docs/images/sync_service.png

Google Calendar Connector Sync Service process overview:

  # On a configurable and periodic basis (default 15 minutes), the Google Calendar Connector Sync Service queries Active Directory using LDAP for the list of users who are defined as Google Calendar users. This list of users is defined by an custom LDAP filter in the Google Calendar Connector Sync Service configuration file. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # Active Directory returns to the Google Calendar Connector Sync Service each user and their e-mail address that matches the LDAP query.
  # The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service uses the Google Calendar GData API (HTTP/XML) to request free/busy information from Google Calendar for the users match by the LDAP query. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service writes new free/busy messages to the Exchange free/busy store via WebDAV for non-Exchange users. For Exchange users the Google Calendar Connector Sync Service writes a new placeholder appointment to the user's calendar. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # If an appointment is created in Step 4, Exchange will populate the free/busy store with an appropriate free/busy message. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service generates an XML file that contains the last time each user was synchronized. On the next scheduled synchronization a check is performed to determine if the user's calendar data has changed or not. If no changes are detected no data is downloaded for that user.

Typical use case:

  # A Microsoft Exchange user looks up free/busy information for a Google Apps user within Microsoft Outlook.
  # Microsoft Outlook issues a free/busy look up request to the Exchange free/busy store for the Google Apps user.
  # Because the Google Calendar Connector Sync Service has populated the Exchange free/busy store with free/busy messages for the Google Apps users, relevant free/busy data is returned to Microsoft Outlook.

Notes about data security and access permissions:

  * 1. The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service needs access to an LDAP login and password with standard "Domain User" privileges.
  * 3. The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service authenticates using a Google Apps Administrator account to retrieve the GData free/busy feeds.
  * 4. The Google Calendar Connector Sync Service writes free/busy messages to the free/busy store using an Active Directory account with write permission to the free/busy store for other users. This requires an Exchange account with Admin privileges.
  * 5. If the Appointment writer is used instead of the !SchedulePlus writer, the Google Calendar Connector Sync Service must use an Active Directory account with write permission to the Exchange users' calendar.

= Google Calendar Connector Plug-In =

The Google Calendar Connector Plug-In allows Microsoft Exchange users to request, in real-time, free/busy information for Google Apps users. The Plug-In is a Java Windows service (with a supplemental .NET executable) that handles free/busy requests from the Novell !GroupWise Calendar Connector for Microsoft Exchange.  When a Microsoft Exchange user looks up free/busy information for a Google Apps user, Exchange issues a free/busy request that is serviced by the Google Calendar Connector Plug-In.  The Google Calendar Connector Plug-in translates the request and queries Google Apps using the Google Calendar GData API. The free/busy data is then returned to Microsoft Exchange for it to present to the requesting user. The Google Calendar Connector Plug-In should be installed on the same server as the Novell !GroupWise Calendar Connector for Microsoft Exchange.

http://google-calendar-connectors.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/connectors/docs/images/free_busy_request.png

http://google-calendar-connectors.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/connectors/docs/images/plugin_user_sync.png

The following is a process overview of the Google Calendar Connector Plug-In: Google Calendar Connector Plug-in free/busy request:

  # A Microsoft Exchange user in Microsoft Outlook attempts to look up free/busy information for a Google Apps user.
  # Microsoft Outlook forwards the free/busy request to the Novell GroupWise Calendar Connector using a file-based API request.
  # The Google Calendar Connector Plug-In parses the free/busy request from Microsoft Outlook.
  # The Google Calendar Connector Plug-In queries Google Apps for the free/busy data via the Google Calendar GData API. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # The Google Calendar Connector Plug-In writes the returned result back to the Novell GroupWise Calendar Connector using the file-based API response.
  # Microsoft Outlook is returned the free/busy data and displays the free/busy data from Google Apps.


Notes about data security and access permissions:

  * 4. The Google Calendar Connector Plug-In authenticates using a Google Apps Administrator account to retrieve the GData free/busy feeds. All GData API authentication and data is transferred securely via HTTPS.

Google Calendar Plug-in Directory/User Synchronization:

  # The Novell GroupWise Calendar Connector requests via the file-based API a directory synchronization. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # The Google Calendar Connector Plug-in reads the file-based API request.
  # The Google Calendar Connector Plug-in will enumerate all users in the Google Apps Domain via the GData API. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # The Google Calendar Connector Plug-in will perform an LDAP query to Active Directory if configured based on the whitelist or blacklist setting in the configuration file.
  # The Google Calendar Connector Plug-in will include or filter out users from the user list returned from Google Apps based on the whitelist and blacklist data returned from Active Directory.
  # The Google Calendar Connector Plug-in will write a file-based API response with the list of Google Apps users with the whitelist/blacklist filters applied.
  # The NNovell GroupWise Calendar Connector will process the file-based API response file and create or delete GroupWise addressed contact objects based on the list of users returned in the file-based API response from the Google Calendar Connector Plug-in
  # The Google Calendar Connector Plug-in will execute the FreeBusyBuilder helper .Net application.
  # The FreeBusyBuilder application queries LDAP for all GroupWise addressed contacts. *(_See Security Note_)*
  # The FreeBusyBuilder application verifies or creates the proper MAPI attributes in the Exchange free/busy store. These MAPI attributes configure Exchange to use the Novell GroupWise Calendar Connector for the imported GroupWise (i.e Google Apps) contacts for free/busy requests. *(_See Security Note_)*

Notes about data security and access permissions:

  * 1. The Novell GroupWise Calendar Connector requires a local administrator account on the server it is running.
  * 3. The Google Apps domain must have the Provisioning API enabled for account enumeration. GData API authentication and data is transferred securely via HTTPS.
  * 9. The user account the Google Calendar Connector Plug-in service logs on as must have access to query Active Directory as a "Domain User" as this account is used to execute the FreeBusyBuilder.exe help application.
  * 10. The user account the Google Calendar Connector Plug-in service logs on as must have read and write access to the Exchange free/busy store as this account is used to execute the FreeBusyBuilder.exe help application.

= Security considerations =

The following are important security considerations to review when deploying the Google Calendar Connector Kit.
 
== Limiting access to the Web Service ==

The Google Calendar Connector Web Service does NOT provide an authentication layer for choosing which requests for free/busy information and appointment details to allow or dis-allow.  Anyone who knows the URL address of your Web Service and has network access to its URL would theoretically be able to perform Microsoft Exchange free/busy look ups and, if enabled, retrieve appointment details to the same degree as any user of your Google Apps domain. 

*Therefore, to restrict access to the Web Service to members of your Google Apps domain, we recommend:*

 * Using a private Web Service URL in your company's internal network that is not accessible outside of your company's VPN / Firewall.

== Transport security ==

  * *Google Calendar Connector Web Service:* The Web Service supports passing free/busy information using HTTP or HTTPS. To enable HTTPS mode, perform the following steps:
  # Use Google Calendar in HTTPS mode or force HTTPS mode for your entire Google Apps domain.
  # Provide an *https:// * Web Service URL to your Google support representative.

  If Google Calendar is configured with an HTTPS url that fails, it will not fallback to HTTP. Free/busy information is not publicly broadcast, and when Google Calendar and the Web Service are using HTTPS, POST communications use SSL encryption in transit.

  * *Google Calendar Connector Sync Service: * Free/busy information is downloaded from Google Calendar using a Google Apps administrator account and an authenticated GData feed over HTTPS.
  * *Google Calendar Connector Plug-In: * Free/busy information is downloaded from Google Calendar using a Google Apps administrator account and an authenticated GData feed over HTTPS.

== Account Privileges ==

The Google Calendar Connectors generally require a Google Apps account to access Google Calendar information, a Windows system account to access the local file system, and an Active Directory account to interact with Active Directory and Microsoft Exchange.  The following is a summary of the various accounts you will configure during the setup of the various Google Calendar Connectors.

=== Google Calendar Connector Web Service: ===

  # Google Apps user account.
  # Active Directory user with standard DOMAIN USER privileges.
  # Active Directory user with Read-Access to the free/busy store (retrieving free/busy).
  # Active Directory user with Exchange extended "Receive As" privileges to read user's appointment details.
  # The Windows System account NETWORK SERVICE is used by ASP.NET and needs MODIFY privileges to:
   * C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\{Virtual Web Application Directory}
   * C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\{Virtual Web Application Directory}\Web.config
   * GoogleApps.GCal.LogDirectory

=== Google Calendar Connector Sync Service: ===

  # Google Apps user account.
  # Active Directory user with standard DOMAIN USER privileges.
  # Active Directory user with Exchange extended "Receive As" privileges for writing free/busy or appointment details.
  # The Windows System account SYSTEM requires:
   * MODIFY privileges for SyncServiceXmlStorageDirectory
   * MODIFY privileges for the install directory

=== Google Calendar Connector Plug-In: ===

  # Google Apps Administrator account.
  # Local server user account with READ/WRITE privileges to the Novell GroupWise Calendar Connector API path.
  # Active Directory DOMAIN USER credentials for querying via LDAP and writing free/busy store MAPI attributes.

== Free/busy and appointment details privacy ==

Free/busy information is generally available to all users of the domain, without restriction. An exception is appointment detail information, which is only shared if it is not private. Explicit sharing of appointment detail information is not required.

  * *Google Calendar Connector Web Service:*
  Free/busy information is accessible by any domain user, for any domain user who has free/busy information in the Exchange free/busy public store. Appointment details are available for any domain user, if the appointment detail look up is enabled and if the appointment is not marked as private. Private event details are not returned to Google Calendar.  See the Security Consideration entitled "Limiting access to the Web Service" for more information.

  * *Google Calendar Connector Sync Service:*
  Free/busy information is accessible by any Google Apps domain user, for all domain users on Google Apps. Appointment details for Google Apps users are not available to Microsoft Exchange users because the free/busy store only allows storage of free/busy data.

  * *Google Calendar Connector Plug-In:*

  Free/busy information is accessible by any Google Apps domain user, for any other domain user on Google Apps. Appointment details are not supported with the Novell GroupWise Connector for Exchange.

== Google Calendar's access to your corporate data ==

The Google Calendar Connectors will only return free/busy information and non-private appointment details from Microsoft Exchange. Only free/busy information is shared from Google Apps. No Microsoft Exchange free/busy information or appointment details are explicitly stored on Google's servers.

=== Google Calendar Connector Web Service: ===

The Google Calendar Scheduler is returned the free/busy and appointment information from your Exchange environment, but this information is not stored on Google's servers, and it only transits Google's servers to be parsed and rendered via javascript within the user's browser.

*_The Web Service responds to any valid requests it receives, and so access to the Web Service URL should be limited appropriately.  See the Security Consideration "Limiting Access to the Web Service" for more details._*

*_Concurrent, malicious javascript execution in the browser could expose your free/busy and appointment information to an outside party.  This is mentioned only as a precaution._*

=== Google Calendar Connector Sync Service: ===

No additional corporate data is exposed to Google Calendar when operating the Sync Service. The Sync Service only reads free/busy information from an authenticated Google Calendar GData feed.

=== Google Calendar Connector Plug-In: ===

No additional corporate data is exposed to Google Calendar when operating the Sync Service.  The Plug-In only reads free/busy information from an authenticated Google Calendar GData feed.

== Configuration file protection and encryption ==

  * The Google Calendar Connectors use configuration files that are installed with the connector software. To protect the sensitive account information in the files, Google recommends you restrict access to these files. The configuration files are stored in plain text which means they can be viewed with a standard text editor. The Google Calendar Connector Web Service and the Google Calendar Connector Sync Service can optionally have their appSettings node encrypted, rendering their sensitive information permanently unreadable. The Google Calendar Connector Plug-in supports password obfuscation or encryption.
